    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>When you make an enquiry, submit a referral, or otherwise contact us, we may collect information such as your name, phone number, email address, suburb, preferred language, and details about the NDIS support you're seeking. We only ask for the information needed to respond to your enquiry — our general enquiry form does not request detailed health information.</p>

    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to your enquiry or referral</li>
      <li>To assess and, where you proceed with us, deliver NDIS supports</li>

      <li>To communicate with your plan manager or support coordinator, where you've consented to this</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your information, and we do not use it for marketing purposes beyond responding to your own enquiry.</p>

    <h2>Who we share information with</h2>
    <p>We may share relevant information with your nominated plan manager, support coordinator or other NDIS providers involved in your support, but only with your consent or as required by law or the NDIS Practice Standards.</p>

    <h2>How we store your information</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information secure and to protect it from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
